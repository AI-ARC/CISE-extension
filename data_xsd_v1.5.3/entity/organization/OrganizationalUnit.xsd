			<xs:documentation>In some cases it is useful to refer to departments or organizational units such as the IT department which only have meaning within the context of the containing organization and would not be regarded as a legal entity in its own right. This situation is supported by a subclass of Organization called OrganizationalUnit.</xs:documentation>
